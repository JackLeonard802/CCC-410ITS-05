# IoT Exploration

Since the introduction of the Amazon Echo, I have been fascinated by how quickly smart devices have become integrated into the fabric of our lives, and how willing people are to use these devices. Things like smart TVs, security cameras, digital assistants, and even LED lights can connect to local networks, and as such they send and recieve data constantly. Evaluating the data that these devices send would give a great deal of insight into how much trust we should put in them, and could also expose avenues for threat actors to use to stage attacks.

Devices currently available

* Unconfigured Echo Dot

* Fully configured and well used Echo Dot

* Smart LED strips

* Smart TVs

  * TCL
  * Visio

* 2 ring cameras

* Xfinity XiOne TV box

  * Similar to Roku device

## Objectives

* View stored data on each device 

* Attempt to view data in transit from each device

* Analyze the contents of data sent and recieved

* Do these devices pose security risks to a network?

* Is any sensitive information being sent and recieved? Is it accessible?
