# Steganography

> Note: In this context I am referring to digital steganography. Physical steganography is certainly interesting, but it is outside of the scope of this proposal. 

Steganography is a technique that can be used by threat actors to embed maliscious data into digital objects such as images. It is difficult to plainly detect, and as such it is very effective. When I learned that attacks with steganography were possible, I was surpised, intrigued, and immediately paranoid. I would like to research the ways in which steganography has been used in the past, how it is used in the present, and the extent to which it can be used.

## Objectives

* Investigate the ways in which steganography has been used in the past

* Investigate the ways in which steganography is presently used

* Evaluate the legitimate uses of steganography

* Evaluate the malicious use of steganography

* Investigate the mediums that can be used for steganography. Some examples:

  * Images
  * Audio
  * Videos
  * Word documents

* Investigate how much data can be embedded before detection

  > I think a survey would do well here. A row of images with increasing amounts of embedded data could be presented, and the survey taker could choose when they begin to notice significant changes in the images.
