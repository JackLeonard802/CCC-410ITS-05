# IoT Exploration Device List

This document serves as the list of devices I will be analyzing in my IoT exploration project

* Configured/used Amazon Echo Dot
* Unconfigured Amazon Echo Dot
These devices seem to show the most promise for this poject. Given that I have two devices in differing states of configuration, I will be able to use the unconfigured device as a control to gauge the difference in network traffic and stored data that is present in the configured device. One hurdle that I will need to look further into with these devices is firmware extraction, as this is not a field that I am exceptionally familiar with.

* TCL smart TV with Roku
This device will likely present a great deal of network traffic, given its form of daily use. It will also likely contain a fair amount of stored data, given the number of accounts that have been added, in addition to the configuration that has been done on the device. Again, a hurdle here will be firmware/data extraction, as this is not a field I am very familiar with.

* Three configured/used Ring security cameras
These cameras will likely present a good deal of traffic, given the frequency at which they are active. I do not expect to find a great deal of stored data in these devices however, as I believe that the data they collect is stored on the cloud. Still, it is something worth looking into in this case. Firmware/data extraction will be another hurdle that I will likely encounter when analyzing these devices.

* Xfinity XiOne TV box
Data analysis on this device will likely look similar to the analysis done on the TCL smart TV. However, this device is unconfigured, meaning that I could potentially use it as a control with which to compare the data gathered from the smart TV. Yet again, firmware/data extraction will be a challenge with this device.
